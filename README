NAME
    Data::Perl - Base classes wrapping fundamental Perl data types.

VERSION
    version 0.002009

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Perl;

      my $array = array(1,2,3, qw/a b c/);

      $array->count; # 6

      my @elements = $array->grep(sub {/b/}); # (b)

      my $hash = hash(a => 1, b => 2);

      $hash->keys; # ('a', 'b');

      my $number = number(5);

      $number->add(10); # 15

      my $string = string("foo\n");

      $string->chomp; # return 1, chomps string

      my $counter = counter();

      $counter->inc; # counter is now 1

      my $sub = code(sub { 'foo' });

      $sub->execute; # returns 'foo'

      $foo

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Perl is a collection of classes that wrap fundamental data types
    that exist in Perl. These classes and methods as they exist today are an
    attempt to mirror functionality provided by Moose's Native Traits. One
    important thing to note is all classes currently do no validation on
    constructor input.

    Data::Perl is a container class for the following classes:

    *   Data::Perl::Collection::Hash

    *   Data::Perl::Collection::Array

    *   Data::Perl::String

    *   Data::Perl::Number

    *   Data::Perl::Counter

    *   Data::Perl::Bool

    *   Data::Perl::Code

ALPHA API
    The API provided by these modules is as of now considered alpha and
    undecided. The API WILL change. If you are writing code that you will
    not touch again for years, do not use this until this warning is
    removed.

PROVIDED FUNCTIONS
    Data::Perl exports helper constructor functions to interface with the
    above classes:

    *   hash(key, value, ...)

        Returns a Data::Perl::Collection::Hash object initialized with the
        optionally passed in key/value args.

    *   array(@args)

        Returns a Data::Perl::Collection::Array object initialized with the
        optionally passed in values.

    *   string($arg)

        Returns a Data::Perl::String object initialized with the optionally
        passed in scalar arg.

    *   number($arg)

        Returns a Data::Perl::Number object initialized with the optionally
        passed in scalar arg.

    *   counter($arg)

        Returns a Data::Perl::Counter object initialized with the optionally
        passed in scalar arg.

    *   bool($arg)

        Returns a Data::Perl::Bool object initialized with the truth value
        of the passed in scalar arg.

    *   code($arg)

        Returns a Data::Perl::Code object initialized with the optionally
        passed in scalar coderef as an arg.

THANKS
    Much thanks to the Moose team for their work with native traits, for
    which much of this work is based.
